Jared Hocutt is a Manager at Red Hat where he leads the DoD / IC team of
Specialist Solution Architects. In his previous role at Red Hat, he was a
Principal Solution Architect focused on OpenShift, Red Hat's opinionated
Kubernetes distribution. He is largely focused on the success of Kubernetes in
the U.S. government and their supporting entities.

Before his time at Red Hat, Jared started his career working in the enterprise
storage sector building testbed automation and data visualization tools to test
and monitor performance of storage platforms at NetApp. Towards the end of his
tenure at NetApp, Docker and soon after, Kubernetes were being introduced to
the industry. Before his departure from NetApp, he helped build the first
Docker storage driver for NetApp platforms and architect the first Kubernetes
dynamic storage provisioner for NetApp platforms.

Jared is a husband and the father to a wonderful daughter, who consumes most of
his free time. When he has some to spare, he enjoys biking, woodworking, and
flying drones.
